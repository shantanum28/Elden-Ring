### **How to Defeat Maliketh, the Black Blade in Elden Ring**

Maliketh, the Black Blade, is a two-phase boss fight located at the end of Crumbling Farum Azula. This encounter is one of the most challenging in *Elden Ring*, requiring precise timing, positioning, and adaptability. Below is a detailed guide to help you defeat Maliketh and claim victory.

### **Preparation Before the Fight**

1. **Recommended Level and Gear**:
   - **Level**: Aim for **Level 100–120+**.
   - **Weapon Upgrade**: +15 or higher for standard weapons, or +7 or higher for special weapons.
   - Equip armor with good **physical resistance** and decent **Holy resistance**, as Maliketh’s second phase deals Holy damage.
   - Avoid using Holy damage-based weapons or spells, as Maliketh is highly resistant to it.

2. **Consumables**:
   - Use *Holyproof Dried Liver* or equip the *Haligdrake Talisman* to reduce Holy damage in Phase 2.
   - Bring plenty of healing flasks and FP-restoring items if you’re using Spirit Ashes or magic.

3. **Spirit Ashes**:
   - Summon tanky Spirit Ashes like *Mimic Tear* or *Black Knife Tiche*. These summons can distract Maliketh, giving you openings to attack.
   - Avoid weaker summons that cannot survive his AoE attacks.

4. **Blasphemous Claw**:
   - If you completed Knight Bernahl’s questline in Crumbling Farum Azula, you’ll have the *Blasphemous Claw*. This item can parry specific glowing sword attacks in Phase 2, temporarily stunning Maliketh and creating a massive damage window.

5. **Build-Specific Tips**:
   - **Melee Builds**: Use heavy-hitting weapons with Bleed or Frostbite effects (e.g., Bloodhound’s Fang or Frost-infused weapons).
   - **Magic Builds**: Use fast-casting spells like *Rock Sling* or *Stars of Ruin*. Avoid slow spells due to Maliketh’s speed.
   - **Status Effects**: Scarlet Rot and Bleed are very effective against him.

### **Phase 1: Beast Clergyman**

The first phase pits you against the Beast Clergyman, a fast-moving boss with powerful melee attacks and ranged spells. 

#### **Key Attacks to Watch For**:
1. **Stone Throw**: The Beast Clergyman throws stones at you from a distance. Roll sideways to avoid them.
2. **Ground Slash AoE**: He slashes the ground, creating a shockwave that travels forward. Jump over it or roll sideways.
3. **Dagger Combos**: He performs quick melee combos with his dagger. Dodge into him to avoid these attacks.
4. **Leaping Slam**: He leaps into the air and slams down with his dagger, creating an AoE shockwave. Roll away from the impact zone.

#### **Strategy for Phase 1**:
1. Stay close to him but avoid standing directly in front of him to minimize damage from his dagger combos.
2. Use heavy attacks or jump attacks to build up stagger damage for a posture break.
3. When he uses ranged stone attacks, close the gap quickly to prevent him from spamming them.
4. Save your Spirit Ashes for Phase 2 unless you’re struggling with this phase.

### **Phase 2: Maliketh, the Black Blade**

At 50% health, the Beast Clergyman transforms into Maliketh, the Black Blade. This phase introduces devastating Holy damage attacks that reduce your max HP temporarily and cause damage over time.

#### **Key Attacks to Watch For**:
1. **Destined Death Explosion**: Maliketh slams his sword into the ground, creating a delayed explosion around him. Move away as soon as he plunges his blade into the ground.
2. **Black Blade Projectiles**: He fires red projectiles from his sword while leaping through the air. Roll toward him just before they hit to avoid them.
3. **Spinning Slash AoE**: Maliketh performs a spinning slash attack that hits in a wide radius around him. Roll into him to avoid getting hit by the follow-up swings.
4. **Glowing Sword Attacks (Parryable)**: His sword glows gold during certain attacks (e.g., overhead slams). Use the Blasphemous Claw to parry these moves and stun him temporarily.

#### **Strategy for Phase 2**:
1. Stay close to Maliketh at all times—his ranged attacks are far more dangerous than his melee combos.
2. Focus on dodging toward him rather than away when he swings his sword; this minimizes the risk of being hit by wide arcs or AoEs.
3. Use jump attacks or heavy strikes after dodging his combos to build stagger damage and potentially posture-break him for a critical hit.
4. If you’re using Spirit Ashes, let them distract Maliketh while you attack from behind or during openings after his big moves.

### **General Tips**
- **Positioning is Key**: Stay underneath or behind Maliketh whenever possible to avoid frontal cone AoEs and projectiles.
- **Use Pillars for Cover**: The arena has pillars that can block some of his ranged attacks in both phases but be cautious as some moves can bypass them.
- **Patience Over Aggression**: Don’t overcommit; focus on learning his patterns and attacking during safe windows.
- **Healing Windows**: Heal only after dodging major attacks like Destined Death explosions or spinning slashes.

### **Rewards for Defeating Maliketh**
1. **220,000 Runes**, a massive reward for leveling up or upgrading gear.
2. **Remembrance of the Black Blade**, which can be exchanged at Roundtable Hold for either:
   - *Maliketh’s Black Blade*: A colossal sword that deals Holy damage and reduces max HP on hit.
   - *Black Blade Incantation*: A powerful spell that deals Holy damage and reduces max HP over time.
3. Access to Leyndell, Ashen Capital, marking a major turning point in your journey toward becoming Elden Lord.

Maliketh is one of *Elden Ring’s* most demanding bosses due to his speed, aggression, and devastating AoEs in Phase 2. With proper preparation, careful observation of his patterns, and strategic use of tools like Spirit Ashes and the Blasphemous Claw, you can overcome this formidable foe and continue your quest toward ultimate victory!
