### **How to Defeat Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy in Elden Ring**

Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy, is one of the most unique and cinematic boss fights in *Elden Ring*. This two-phase encounter takes place in Volcano Manor and heavily relies on a special weapon mechanic. Below is a detailed guide to help you defeat him.

### **Preparation Before the Fight**

1. **Recommended Level and Gear**:
   - Aim for **Level 70+**.
   - Equip armor with high **Fire resistance**, as much of Rykard's damage is fire-based.
   - Bring plenty of healing flasks and FP-restoring items (e.g., Cerulean Flasks) to sustain your attacks.

2. **Serpent-Hunter Weapon**:
   - The fight revolves around the *Serpent-Hunter*, a special weapon found immediately upon entering the boss arena. This weapon has no stat requirements and deals massive damage to Rykard due to its unique interaction with him.
   - You can upgrade the Serpent-Hunter with Somber Smithing Stones before the fight to make it even more powerful, though this is not strictly necessary.

3. **Consumables**:
   - Use Fireproof Dried Liver or equip the Flamedrake Talisman to reduce fire damage.
   - Equip FP-restoring items like *Starlight Shards* or *Cerulean Hidden Tear* in your Flask of Wondrous Physick.

4. **Spirit Ashes**:
   - Summon Spirit Ashes like Mimic Tear or Redmane Knight Ogha for additional support. These summons can distract Rykard and deal extra damage.

### **Phase 1: God-Devouring Serpent**

The first phase pits you against the God-Devouring Serpent, a massive snake-like creature that uses poison, fire, and physical attacks.

#### **Key Attacks to Watch For**:
1. **Bite Attack**: The serpent lunges forward with its mouth open. Dodge sideways to avoid it.
2. **Poison Breath**: It spews poison in a wide arc. Back away or circle around to avoid the cloud.
3. **Lava Pools**: The serpent leaves lava trails after certain attacks. Avoid standing in these areas as they deal continuous damage.
4. **Tail Swipe**: If you're positioned behind it, the serpent may use a tail swipe to knock you back.

#### **Strategy**:
1. Equip the *Serpent-Hunter* weapon immediately upon entering the arena.
2. Use its special weapon skill (*Great Serpent Hunt*) for long-range thrusts that deal significant damage to the serpent.
3. Stay at mid-range and time your attacks between its moves, as the *Serpent-Hunter* has excellent range and can hit from a safe distance.
4. Watch for its grab attack (telegraphed by a roar) and dodge backward to avoid being caught.
5. Keep moving to avoid poison clouds and lava pools while focusing on hitting its head for maximum damage.

### **Phase 2: Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy**

Once the serpent's health is depleted, Rykard reveals his true form, wielding a massive flaming sword alongside his serpent body.

#### **Key Attacks to Watch For**:
1. **Skull Barrage**: Rykard summons fiery skulls that home in on you. Keep moving or roll through them to avoid damage.
2. **Flaming Sword Swings**: He performs wide sword sweeps that leave fire trails on the ground. Time your rolls carefully to evade these attacks.
3. **Explosive Slam**: He slams his sword into the ground, creating an explosive AoE attack. Back away when you see him raise his sword high.
4. **Lava Eruption**: He summons lava eruptions around him that spread across the arena. Stay at mid-range during this move.

#### **Strategy**:
1. Continue using the *Serpent-Hunter* weapon’s special skill (*Great Serpent Hunt*) from mid-range to deal massive damage safely.
2. Summon Spirit Ashes if they have died during Phase 1; they can distract Rykard while you attack.
3. Dodge toward his sword swings rather than away from them to minimize damage from their wide arcs.
4. When he summons fiery skulls, sprint or roll repeatedly until they dissipate.
5. Be cautious of his AoE attacks—back off when he raises his sword high or when lava erupts from the ground.

### **General Tips**
- **Positioning**: Stay at mid-range where you can effectively use the *Serpent-Hunter*’s long-range thrusts without being too close to his lava pools or sword sweeps.
- **FP Management**: The *Serpent-Hunter*’s special skill consumes FP quickly, so ensure you have enough Cerulean Flasks or FP-restoring items during both phases.
- **Patience Over Aggression**: Focus on dodging first and attacking during safe windows—Rykard’s moves are powerful but have clear telegraphs.

### **Rewards for Defeating Rykard**
- **130,000 Runes**: A significant reward for leveling up or upgrading gear.
- **Rykard’s Great Rune**: Activates at the Divine Tower of West Altus; restores HP upon defeating enemies when equipped.
- **Remembrance of the Blasphemous**: Can be exchanged at Roundtable Hold for unique weapons like Blasphemous Blade or consumed for Runes.

Rykard’s fight is more about spectacle than difficulty thanks to the *Serpent-Hunter* weapon’s unique mechanics. With proper preparation and careful execution, you’ll emerge victorious against this Shardbearer!
