### **How to Defeat Godrick the Grafted in Elden Ring**

Godrick the Grafted is the first major *Shardbearer* boss in *Elden Ring*, located in Stormveil Castle. As a demigod, he presents a significant challenge with his two-phase fight, featuring devastating melee attacks and fiery dragon-arm abilities. Below is a detailed guide to help you overcome this encounter.

### **Preparation Before the Fight**

1. **Recommended Level and Gear**:
   - Aim for **Level 30+** for a smoother experience.
   - Upgrade your weapon to at least **+3 or higher** using Smithing Stones.
   - Equip armor with decent physical defense and fire resistance.

2. **Summon Nepheli Loux**:
   - Speak to Nepheli Loux in a room near the Secluded Cell Site of Grace. Exhaust her dialogue, and her summon sign will appear near the fog gate. She can distract Godrick and deal significant damage.

3. **Spirit Ashes**:
   - Use Spirit Ashes like Lone Wolves or Spirit Jellyfish. The Spirit Jellyfish is particularly useful due to its high HP and poison capability.

4. **Consumables**:
   - Bring Fireproof Dried Liver or Flame-Resist talismans to mitigate fire damage during Phase 2.
   - Stock up on healing flasks and consider crafting items like Fire Grease or Blood Grease for extra damage.

### **Phase 1: Godrick’s Moveset and Strategy**

In Phase 1, Godrick wields his massive axe and performs a mix of slow but powerful melee attacks, some imbued with wind magic.

#### **Key Attacks to Watch For**:
- **Wind AoE Slam**: Godrick raises his axe and slams it down, creating a wind-based area-of-effect (AoE) attack. Roll backward when you see him lift his weapon.
- **Jumping Slam**: He leaps into the air and crashes down with his axe. Dodge toward him at the last second to avoid damage.
- **Combo Swipes**: Godrick chains together multiple axe swings unpredictably. Stay patient and dodge until he finishes.
- **Tornado Attack**: He spins his axe, summoning storm winds around him. Back away to avoid being caught in the AoE.

#### **Strategy**:
1. Summon Nepheli Loux and Spirit Ashes at the start of the fight to split his attention.
2. Focus on dodging rather than blocking, as his attacks can stagger you even through shields.
3. Use jumping heavy attacks (R2) to deal poise damage and potentially stagger him for a critical hit.
4. Attack during openings after his long combos or when he recovers from big moves like the jumping slam.

### **Phase 2: Dragon Arm Transformation**

At 50% health, Godrick severs his own arm and grafts a dragon’s head onto it, gaining fiery ranged attacks alongside his melee arsenal.

#### **Key Attacks to Watch For**:
- **Flamethrower Breath**: Godrick breathes fire in a wide arc or directly in front of him. Stay behind him during this attack for free hits.
- **Fire Slam Combo**: He slams his dragon arm into the ground multiple times, creating fiery explosions with each hit. Roll away from the impact zones.
- **Dragon Bite**: He lunges forward with his dragon arm for a grab attack that deals massive damage. Dodge sideways as soon as you see him rear back.

#### **Strategy**:
1. Stay close to Godrick during fire-breath attacks but avoid lingering directly in front of him.
2. Use ranged attacks or spells during moments when he’s locked into animations like flamethrower breath.
3. Continue using summons like Nepheli Loux or Spirit Ashes to keep him distracted while you deal damage from behind.
4. Be cautious of his extended combos in this phase; don’t get greedy with your attacks.

### **General Tips**
- **Positioning**: Stick close to Godrick’s sides or behind him whenever possible, as many of his attacks are frontal.
- **Healing Opportunities**: Heal after big moves like the flamethrower breath or jumping slam when he has recovery downtime.
- **Patience Over Aggression**: Avoid overcommitting to attacks; focus on learning his patterns and exploiting safe openings.

### **Rewards for Defeating Godrick**
- **20,000 Runes**: A significant amount for early-game leveling or upgrades.
- **Remembrance of the Grafted**: Can be exchanged for unique weapons or consumed for Runes at Roundtable Hold.
- **Godrick’s Great Rune**: Unlock its power by activating it at the Divine Tower of Limgrave.

Godrick is a test of patience, positioning, and adaptability. With preparation, careful observation of his patterns, and strategic use of summons, you’ll emerge victorious against this daunting foe!
