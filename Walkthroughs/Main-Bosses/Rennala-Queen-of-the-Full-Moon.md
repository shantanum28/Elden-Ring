### [**How to Defeat Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon in Elden Ring**]

Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, is the second major Shardbearer boss in *Elden Ring*, located in the Grand Library of Raya Lucaria Academy. This fight consists of two distinct phases: a puzzle-like first phase and a more traditional duel in the second phase. Below is a detailed guide to help you defeat her.

### [**Preparation Before the Fight**]

1. **[Recommended Level and Gear]**:
   - Aim for **Level 40+**.
   - Equip armor with **high Magic resistance** to mitigate damage in Phase 2.
   - Use physical-damage weapons, as Rennala has high Magic resistance. Weapons like Bloodhound's Fang or upgraded katanas are effective.

2. **[Spirit Ashes]**:
   - Summon Spirit Ashes like Lone Wolves or Spirit Jellyfish for distractions during Phase 2.
   - Upgrade your Spirit Ashes to maximize their effectiveness.

3. **[Consumables]**:
   - Bring items like Magic Fortification or Fireproof Dried Liver to increase survivability.
   - Use Grease (e.g., Blood or Fire Grease) to enhance your weapon's damage output.

4. **[Preparation for Magic Users]**:
   - Avoid relying on Magic damage, as Rennala has extremely high Magic negation.
   - Use spells like *Rock Sling* (Physical damage) or weapons that scale with Intelligence but deal Physical damage (e.g., Moonveil or Carian Knight’s Sword).

### [**Phase 1: Breaking Rennala’s Shield**]

In Phase 1, Rennala floats above the arena, protected by a golden shield while surrounded by her minions (Juvenile Scholars). The goal is to break her shield and deal damage during her vulnerable state.

#### [**Steps to Break Her Shield**:]
1. Look for minions with a **golden aura** around them—they are singing and glowing.
2. Kill three of these glowing minions to shatter Rennala’s shield and send her crashing to the ground.
3. Once she falls, deal as much damage as possible before she reactivates her shield.

#### [**Key Tips for Phase 1**:]
- Ignore non-glowing minions unless they block your path.
- Avoid standing still, as Rennala occasionally casts AoE magic attacks from above.
- Use ranged attacks like Throwing Daggers or arrows to quickly kill glowing minions from a distance.

#### [**Repeat Until Phase 2**:]
- You will need to repeat this process 2–3 times depending on your damage output. Save healing flasks for Phase 2 if possible.

### [**Phase 2: The Moonlit Duel**]

After a cutscene, Rennala transports you to an ethereal arena surrounded by water and moonlight. Here, she uses devastating magical abilities and summons Spirit Ashes to aid her.

#### [**Rennala’s Key Attacks in Phase 2**:]
1. **[Magic Projectiles]**: She fires tracking magic missiles that can be dodged by rolling sideways.
2. **[Magic Beam (Comet Azur)]**: A powerful straight-line beam attack that can one-shot you if hit. Dodge sideways as soon as she begins charging it.
3. **[Icy Crystals]**: Rennala summons ice shards that explode after a delay. Keep moving to avoid them.
4. **[Summons]**: She calls Spirit Ashes such as wolves, giants, or even a dragon. These disappear after a short time—focus on dodging them rather than engaging.

#### [**Strategy for Phase 2**:]
1. At the start of the phase, sprint directly toward Rennala and attack aggressively before she casts her first spell.
2. Stay close to her throughout the fight—her spells are easier to dodge at close range, and she has low poise, making her susceptible to stagger from repeated melee attacks.
3. When she summons Spirit Ashes, avoid engaging them directly; instead, focus on dodging while keeping an eye on Rennala’s position.
4. Use Spirit Ashes like Lone Wolves or Mimic Tear to distract both Rennala and her summons.

#### [**General Tips for Phase 2**:]
- Play aggressively but carefully; overcommitting can leave you vulnerable to her spells.
- Heal during moments when she is summoning or casting slower spells like Comet Azur.
- If you are using ranged attacks, time your shots between her spells and keep moving to avoid tracking projectiles.

### [**Rewards for Defeating Rennala**]

- **[40,000 Runes]**: A significant reward for leveling up or upgrading equipment.
- **[Remembrance of the Full Moon Queen]**: Can be exchanged for unique sorcery-related items at Roundtable Hold.
- **[Great Rune of the Unborn]**: Allows character respec at any time by speaking with Rennala after defeating her.

Rennala’s fight is a test of patience and adaptability. By mastering the mechanics of both phases and preparing adequately beforehand, you’ll emerge victorious against this sorceress and continue your journey through *Elden Ring*!
