### [**How to Defeat Radagon of the Golden Order and Elden Beast in Elden Ring**]

Radagon of the Golden Order and the Elden Beast are the final bosses of *Elden Ring*, fought consecutively without a break. This two-phase battle is a test of endurance, skill, and preparation. Below is a comprehensive guide to help you overcome both phases.

## [**Phase 1: Radagon of the Golden Order**]

### [**Preparation for Radagon**]
1. **[Recommended Level and Gear]**:
   - **[Level]**: Aim for **125–130+**.
   - Equip armor with high **Holy resistance** to mitigate his Holy damage attacks.
   - Use talismans like *Haligdrake Talisman (+2)* or *Lord’s Divine Fortification* incantation for additional Holy resistance.

2. **[Spirit Ashes]**:
   - Summon tanky Spirit Ashes like *Black Knife Tiche* or *Mimic Tear*. These will distract Radagon and allow you to focus on dealing damage.

3. **[Damage Types]**:
   - Radagon is weak to **Fire** and **Black Flame** damage.
   - Avoid using Bleed or Poison weapons, as he is immune to these status effects.

### [**Radagon's Moveset and Strategy**]
Radagon is a melee-focused boss with Holy-infused attacks and delayed combos that punish careless dodging.

#### [**Key Attacks to Watch For**:]
1. **[Hammer Combos]**: Radagon swings his hammer in quick succession. Dodge sideways or into his swings to avoid them.
2. **[Ground Slam (Holy AoE)]**: He slams his hammer into the ground, creating a delayed Holy explosion. Jump over the shockwave or roll at the right moment.
3. **[Gold Breaker (Leaping Slam)]**: Radagon leaps into the air and slams down, creating a large explosion. Dodge toward him just before he lands.
4. **[Elden Shattering (Triple Slam)]**: At 50% health, he slams the ground three times, creating expanding shockwaves. Roll through each wave or jump over them.

#### [**Strategy for Radagon**:]
1. Stay close to Radagon to bait his melee combos, which are easier to dodge than his ranged Holy attacks.
2. Use fire-based weapons or Black Flame incantations like *Black Flame Blade* to deal significant damage over time.
3. Time your dodges carefully—Radagon often delays his attacks to punish early rolls.
4. Save your healing flasks and FP for the second phase (Elden Beast), as this fight is manageable with patience and precise dodging.

## [**Phase 2: Elden Beast**]

After defeating Radagon, the Elden Beast emerges immediately without a break. This celestial entity has a massive health pool, wide-reaching attacks, and high mobility.

### [**Preparation for Elden Beast**]
1. **[Damage Types]**:
   - The Elden Beast is highly resistant to Holy damage but weak to Physical and Black Flame damage.
   - Avoid using status effects like Bleed or Poison, as it is completely immune.

2. **[Gear and Talismans]**:
   - Equip the *Green Turtle Talisman* for faster stamina regeneration, as you'll need it to chase the boss and dodge its relentless attacks.
   - Use talismans that boost physical attack power or defense (*Radagon’s Scarseal*, *Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman*).

3. **[Spirit Ashes]**:
   - If your summon survived Radagon, it can still assist you here by distracting the Elden Beast while you deal damage.

### [**Elden Beast's Moveset and Strategy**]
The Elden Beast uses a mix of Holy sword strikes, ranged magic attacks, and AoEs that force you to stay mobile in its massive arena.

#### [**Key Attacks to Watch For**:]
1. **[Wave of Gold (Sword Slash AoE)]**: The Beast swings its sword, releasing a golden wave that travels across the arena. Dodge through it at the last moment.
2. **[Golden Rings (Ring Prison)]**: It creates concentric golden rings around you that close in before exploding. Run out of the rings or jump over them as they close.
3. **[Elden Stars (Homing Projectiles)]**: Summons a giant homing star that releases smaller tracking projectiles over time. Sprint away while evading other attacks until it dissipates.
4. **[Nebula Swipe]**: Swipes its glowing hand in an arc, leaving behind an explosive nebula cloud. Run sideways or backward to avoid both the swipe and explosion.
5. **[Fire Breath]**: Breathes fire in a wide arc in front of it. Run behind the Beast during this attack for free hits.

#### [**Strategy for Elden Beast**:]
1. Stay close whenever possible but be prepared to reposition when it moves away or uses AoEs.
2. Use high-damage melee weapons or Black Flame incantations like *Black Flame Ritual* for percentage-based damage against its massive health pool.
3. Manage your stamina carefully—always keep enough for dodging its follow-up attacks after landing hits.
4. When it uses *Elden Stars*, focus on running away rather than attacking until the projectiles fade.
5. Avoid locking on when chasing it; instead, manually aim your attacks to maintain better control of your positioning.

### [**General Tips for Both Phases**]
- Conserve healing flasks during Radagon’s fight so you have enough for Elden Beast’s long battle.
- Learn attack patterns through practice; both bosses have telegraphed moves that become easier to dodge with experience.
- If struggling with stamina management, use Torrent in Phase 2 for mobility when chasing down the Elden Beast.

### [**Rewards for Defeating Radagon and Elden Beast**]
1. Access to choose one of several endings based on your progress in various questlines (e.g., Ranni’s ending).
2. Unlocks New Game+ mode after completing the game.
3. The satisfaction of defeating one of *Elden Ring’s* most challenging encounters!

This battle is as much about endurance as skill—stay patient, learn their movesets, and strike during safe openings!
