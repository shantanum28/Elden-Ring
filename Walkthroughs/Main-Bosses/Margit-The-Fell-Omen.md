### [**How to Defeat Margit, the Fell Omen in Elden Ring**]

Margit, the Fell Omen, is the first major boss in *Elden Ring*, acting as the gateway to Stormveil Castle. Known for his aggressive attacks and deceptive combos, Margit is a significant challenge for new players. Below is a detailed guide to help you overcome this formidable foe.

### [**Preparation Before the Fight**]

1. **[Recommended Level and Gear]**:
   - Aim for **Level 20–25** or higher.
   - Upgrade your weapon to at least **+3** using Smithing Stones.
   - Equip a shield with high physical damage resistance (e.g., Beast Crest Heater Shield).

2. **[Acquire Margit’s Shackle]**:
   - Purchase this item from Patches in Murkwater Cave. It can immobilize Margit twice during the fight, creating windows for heavy damage.

3. **[Summon Spirit Ashes]**:
   - Use Spirit Ashes like Lone Wolf Ashes or Jellyfish Ashes to distract Margit.
   - Alternatively, summon Sorcerer Rogier (gold summon sign near the boss door) for additional support.

4. **[Stock Up on Consumables]**:
   - Bring healing flasks and items like Blood Grease or Fire Grease to boost your weapon's damage.

### [**Phase 1: Margit’s Attack Patterns**]

Margit opens with a mix of staff strikes and glowing magical weapons. Key attacks to watch out for:

- **[Magic Blade Combo]**: Margit summons a glowing sword for quick slashes. Dodge side-to-side and counterattack when he pauses.
- **[Tail Swipe]**: If you linger behind him, he’ll use a fast tail swipe. Stay alert and roll backward.
- **[Throwing Daggers]**: When you heal or create distance, he throws glowing knives. Strafe or roll sideways to avoid them.
- **[Jumping Slam]**: Margit leaps into the air and slams down with his staff. Roll toward him just before he lands and punish during his recovery.

#### [Strategy:]
- Stay mid-range to bait his jumping slam or long staff swings, which are easier to counter.
- Use Margit’s Shackle early in this phase to deal heavy damage while he’s immobilized.
- Avoid overcommitting; attack once or twice after dodging his combos.

### [**Phase 2: The Golden Hammer**]

At around 60% health, Margit enters Phase 2 by summoning a massive golden hammer and extending his combos:

- **[Hammer Slam]**: A slow but devastating overhead smash with his golden hammer. Roll sideways at the last moment.
- **[Extended Combos]**: He chains together staff strikes, sword slashes, and hammer swings unpredictably. Learn his rhythm and dodge accordingly.
- **[AoE Smash]**: Occasionally, he performs an area-of-effect hammer slam. Keep your distance when you see him charging it.

#### [Strategy:]
- Use ranged attacks if possible during this phase to avoid his relentless melee combos.
- Summon Spirit Ashes again if they’ve died; their distraction can give you openings.
- Focus on dodging rather than blocking, as many of his attacks deal chip damage through shields.

### [**General Tips**]

1. **[Patience is Key]**:
   - Don’t rush; wait for clear openings after he finishes combos.

2. **[Exploit Weaknesses]**:
   - Margit is vulnerable to Bleed buildup, so weapons like Uchigatana or Blood Grease are effective.

3. **[Stagger Opportunities]**:
   - Use heavy jump attacks or charged Weapon Arts to break his poise and land critical hits.

4. **[Adapt Your Approach]**:
   - If struggling, explore Limgrave further to level up, upgrade gear, and collect helpful items like Spirit Ashes or talismans.

### [**Rewards for Defeating Margit**]

- **[12,000 Runes]**: Enough for several level-ups at this stage of the game.
- **[Talisman Pouch]**: Grants an additional slot for equipping talismans.
- Access to Stormveil Castle, the first Legacy Dungeon in *Elden Ring*.

Margit is designed as an early-game skill check, encouraging players to master dodging, stamina management, and timing their attacks. With preparation and practice, you’ll be able to conquer this challenging foe and continue your journey through *Elden Ring*.
