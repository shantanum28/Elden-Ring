### [**How to Defeat the Fire Giant in Elden Ring**]

The Fire Giant is a mandatory boss located in the Mountaintops of the Giants and serves as a significant challenge in *Elden Ring*. This massive two-phase encounter requires careful positioning, patience, and effective use of Torrent (your horse). Below is a comprehensive guide to help you defeat this colossal foe.

### [**Preparation Before the Fight**]

1. **[Recommended Level and Gear]**:
   - Aim for **Level 100–115+**.
   - Upgrade your weapon to at least **+15** (standard) or **+7** (special) for optimal damage.
   - Equip armor with high **Fire resistance** to mitigate fire damage.
   - Talismans like *Flamedrake Talisman*, *Erdtree’s Favor*, or *Radagon’s Scarseal* can enhance survivability or damage output.

2. **[Consumables]**:
   - Use *Fireproof Dried Liver* or spells like *Flame, Protect Me* for additional fire resistance.
   - Bring plenty of healing flasks and FP-restoring items if you’re using Spirit Ashes.

3. **[Spirit Ashes]**:
   - Summon tanky Spirit Ashes like *Black Knife Tiche* or *Mimic Tear* to distract the Fire Giant while you attack.
   - Avoid low-health summons like wolves, as they can be easily wiped out by his AoE attacks.

4. **[Build-Specific Tips]**:
   - **[Melee Builds]**: Use weapons with high raw damage or status effects like Bleed or Frostbite. The *Antspur Rapier* with Scarlet Rot infusion is particularly effective.
   - **[Magic Builds]**: Use fast-casting spells like *Rock Sling* or *Stars of Ruin*. Avoid slow spells due to the Fire Giant’s mobility.

### [**Phase 1: Targeting the Weak Ankle**]

In Phase 1, the Fire Giant is highly mobile and uses a mix of physical and fire-based attacks.

#### [**Key Attacks to Watch For**:]
1. **[Shield Slam]**: The Fire Giant swings his massive shield, creating shockwaves. Dodge sideways or stay behind him to avoid it.
2. **[Snow Wave]**: He sweeps snow toward you with his shield. Dodge forward into the attack to avoid damage.
3. **[Foot Stomps]**: He stomps his feet, creating AoEs around them. Roll backward or jump on Torrent to avoid these.
4. **[Fire Orb]**: He summons a slow-moving fire orb that explodes after a delay. Trigger it from a safe distance and move away before it detonates.

#### [**Strategy for Phase 1**:]
1. Focus on attacking his **left ankle**, which is wrapped in bandages. Breaking this weak point will stagger him and deal significant damage.
2. Stay underneath or behind him to avoid most of his attacks, but be cautious of foot stomps and shield slams.
3. Use Torrent for mobility to quickly reposition when he moves away or rolls.

### [**Phase 2: The Sacrificial Transformation**]

At 50% health, a cutscene will play where the Fire Giant tears off his leg, revealing an eye-like weak spot on his chest. In this phase, he gains new fire-based abilities but becomes less mobile.

#### [**New Attacks in Phase 2**:]
1. **[Flaming Rocks]**: He spits fiery rocks from the mouth on his chest that explode on impact. Stay mobile on Torrent to avoid them.
2. **[Fire Pillars]**: He summons fiery eruptions around him while kneeling. Move away from glowing areas on the ground to avoid damage.
3. **[Homing Fireballs]**: If you’re far away, he launches homing fireballs that deal massive damage. Stay close to him to prevent this attack.
4. **[Body Slam Rolls]**: He rolls onto his side, crushing anything underneath him. Keep moving and avoid staying directly under him.

#### [**Strategy for Phase 2**:]
1. Continue using hit-and-run tactics with Torrent, focusing on attacking his legs from behind.
2. When he performs a body slam or kneels after an attack, use this opportunity to strike the weak spot on his chest for maximum damage.
3. Avoid lingering too long near his chest as he may use fire breath attacks that deal devastating damage.

### [**General Tips**]
- **[Positioning]**: Stay behind or underneath him during both phases but remain cautious of foot stomps and rolls.
- **[Torrent Usage]**: Use Torrent liberally for mobility, especially when dodging AoE fire attacks or repositioning during the fight.
- **[Status Effects]**: Weapons that inflict Frostbite or Scarlet Rot are highly effective due to their percentage-based damage against his large health pool.
- **[Patience Over Aggression]**: Don’t overcommit; focus on avoiding his attacks first and attacking during safe windows.

### [**Rewards for Defeating the Fire Giant**]
- **[180,000 Runes]**, a significant reward for leveling up or upgrading gear.
- **[Remembrance of the Fire Giant]**, which can be exchanged at Roundtable Hold for unique weapons or consumed for additional Runes.

The Fire Giant is one of *Elden Ring’s* most challenging encounters due to its size and powerful attacks, but with proper preparation and careful execution, you’ll bring down this towering foe and advance your journey toward the Forge of the Giants!
