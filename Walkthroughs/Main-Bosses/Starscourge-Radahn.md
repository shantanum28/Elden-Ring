### **How to Defeat Starscourge Radahn in Elden Ring**

Starscourge Radahn is one of the most iconic and challenging bosses in *Elden Ring*. Known for his immense size, devastating attacks, and gravity magic, this battle takes place in the vast Wailing Dunes and features unique mechanics, including summoning NPC allies to assist you. Below is a detailed guide to help you conquer Radahn.

### **Preparation Before the Fight**

1. **Recommended Level and Gear**:
   - Aim for **Level 70+** for a smoother experience.
   - Upgrade your weapon to at least **+6 or higher** using Smithing Stones.
   - Equip armor with good physical and magic resistance (e.g., Radahn’s arrows and gravity magic can deal massive damage).

2. **Scarlet Rot Strategy**:
   - Radahn is highly vulnerable to Scarlet Rot. Using the *Rotten Breath* incantation or weapons like the *Antspur Rapier* (infused with Scarlet Rot) can significantly weaken him.

3. **Consumables**:
   - Bring Fireproof Dried Liver or Magic Fortification items to reduce damage from his AoE attacks.
   - Use the Flask of Wondrous Physick with defensive buffs like the Opaline Bubbletear or Crimsonburst Crystal Tear for survivability.

4. **Spirit Ashes**:
   - Spirit Ashes are unavailable during this fight, but you can summon multiple NPC allies (see below).

### **Phase 1: The Long-Range Assault**

The fight begins with Radahn firing massive gravity arrows at you from a distance.

#### **Key Attacks in Phase 1**:
- **Homing Gravity Arrows**: Radahn fires powerful arrows that track your position. Dodge sideways just before they hit or use obstacles on the battlefield for cover.
- **Arrow Barrage**: He fires a volley of arrows into the sky that rain down over a wide area. Sprint on Torrent (your horse) in a zig-zag pattern to avoid them.

#### **Strategy**:
1. **Summon Allies**: As soon as the fight begins, run toward the golden summon signs scattered across the arena to call NPC allies like Blaidd, Alexander, and others. These allies will distract Radahn and deal damage.
2. **Approach Carefully**: Use Torrent to close the distance while dodging his arrows. Stay mobile and avoid running in straight lines.
3. **Engage in Melee or Ranged Combat**: Once close, focus on attacking his legs while your allies draw his attention. Use heavy attacks or weapons with Bleed or Scarlet Rot effects for maximum damage.

### **Phase 2: The Meteor Strike**

At around 50% health, Radahn leaps into the sky and disappears momentarily before crashing back down as a flaming meteor.

#### **Key Attacks in Phase 2**:
- **Meteor Slam**: Radahn’s dramatic reentry deals massive AoE damage. Watch the sky for his trajectory and sprint away on Torrent to avoid being hit.
- **Gravity Magic**: He summons rocks that orbit around him or launches them as projectiles. Stay mobile to avoid these attacks.
- **Sword Combos**: His melee combos become more aggressive, with wide swings and ground slams that can hit multiple targets.

#### **Strategy**:
1. **Avoid the Meteor Slam**: As soon as Radahn disappears, look up at the sky and sprint away from his landing point.
2. **Re-Summon Allies**: Many of your summoned NPCs will die during Phase 1 or the meteor attack. Re-summon them using golden signs scattered across the battlefield.
3. **Stick to His Legs**: Focus your attacks on his legs while avoiding his sword swings. Heavy jump attacks can stagger him, opening him up for critical hits.
4. **Scarlet Rot or Bleed Damage**: If you’re using Scarlet Rot, reapply it during this phase for consistent damage over time.

### **General Tips**
- **Positioning**: Stay behind or beneath Radahn whenever possible to avoid his frontal attacks.
- **Healing Opportunities**: Heal after dodging big moves like sword slams or gravity magic when he’s locked into animations.
- **Patience Over Aggression**: Avoid overcommitting to attacks; focus on dodging and attacking during safe windows.

### **Rewards for Defeating Starscourge Radahn**
- **70,000 Runes**: A significant reward for leveling up or upgrading gear.
- **Remembrance of the Starscourge**: Can be exchanged for powerful weapons at Roundtable Hold.
- Unlocks access to Nokron, Eternal City, advancing Ranni’s questline.

Radahn is a test of endurance, strategy, and adaptability. With careful preparation, use of NPC summons, and mastery of his attack patterns, you’ll emerge victorious against this legendary foe!
