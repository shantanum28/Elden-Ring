### [**How to Defeat Morgott, the Omen King in Elden Ring**]

Morgott, the Omen King, is a mandatory boss in *Elden Ring* and the true identity of Margit, the Fell Omen. He serves as the final boss of Leyndell, Royal Capital, and defeating him is essential to access the Mountaintops of the Giants. Below is a detailed guide to help you overcome this challenging encounter.

### [**Preparation Before the Fight**]

1. **[Recommended Level and Gear]**:
   - **[Level]**: Aim for **Level 75–80+**.
   - **[Weapon Upgrade]**: +15 or higher for standard weapons, or +6 or higher for special weapons.
   - Equip armor with high **Holy resistance**, as many of Morgott’s attacks deal Holy damage.

2. **[Margit’s Shackle]**:
   - If you still have Margit’s Shackle from earlier in the game (purchased from Patches), it can be used twice during Phase 1 to briefly stun Morgott, giving you free openings to attack.

3. **[Consumables]**:
   - Use items like *Holyproof Dried Liver* or equip the *Haligdrake Talisman* to boost Holy resistance.
   - Bring plenty of healing flasks and FP-restoring items if you’re using Spirit Ashes or magic.

4. **[Spirit Ashes]**:
   - Summon tanky Spirit Ashes like *Banished Knight Oleg* or *Mimic Tear* to distract Morgott and create openings for your attacks.

5. **[Build-Specific Tips]**:
   - **[Melee Builds]**: Use weapons that deal Slash damage (e.g., katanas or curved swords), as Morgott is weak to Slash attacks.
   - **[Magic Builds]**: Avoid Holy spells; instead, use Fire or Lightning-based Sorceries and Incantations.
   - **[Status Effects]**: Morgott is vulnerable to Bleed, Frostbite, Poison, and Scarlet Rot. Weapons or spells that apply these effects can significantly weaken him.

### [**Phase 1: Familiar Moves with New Twists**]

Morgott’s first phase reuses many moves from Margit but with added Holy effects and increased aggression.

#### [**Key Attacks in Phase 1**:]
1. **[Dagger Throws]**: He throws three Holy daggers in quick succession. Dodge sideways to avoid them.
2. **[Hammer Slam Combo]**: Morgott conjures a hammer and performs sweeping attacks followed by a slam. Roll into his swings and counterattack after he finishes.
3. **[Spear Thrusts]**: He conjures a spear for quick thrusts or wide sweeps. Watch his left hand to anticipate these moves and dodge accordingly.

#### [**Strategy for Phase 1**:]
- Use Margit’s Shackle early in this phase to immobilize him twice for free damage.
- Stay mid-range to bait out his slower attacks like hammer slams or spear thrusts, which are easier to punish.
- Avoid overcommitting; attack once or twice after dodging his combos.

### [**Phase 2: Enhanced Aggression and New Abilities**]

At 50% health, Morgott transitions into Phase 2 by charging an AoE explosion. Back away immediately when he kneels down to avoid being hit.

#### [**New Attacks in Phase 2**:]
1. **[Sword Rain (Holy Swords)]**: Morgott summons dozens of swords above the arena that rain down after a delay in an "X" pattern. Move between the gaps in the pattern while keeping an eye on his position.
2. **[Bloodflame Blade]**: He coats his sword with Bloodflame, increasing its damage and adding Hemorrhage buildup. Dodge sideways during his swings and punish during recovery.
3. **[Bloodflame Grab]**: A deadly grab attack where he lunges forward with his sword. Sprint away or dodge through it at the last moment.
4. **[Geysers]**: Some of his ground strikes now create fiery geysers that erupt after a delay—stay mobile to avoid these areas.

#### [**Strategy for Phase 2**:]
- Save your Spirit Ashes for this phase if possible; they can distract Morgott while you focus on dodging his new abilities.
- Focus on attacking during recovery windows after big moves like Bloodflame slashes or AoE geysers.
- Stay patient—his increased aggression can be overwhelming, but many of his attacks leave him open if you time your counters correctly.

### [**General Tips**]
- **[Parrying Opportunity]**: Morgott’s sword attacks can be parried, but it takes three successful parries to break his stance for a critical hit.
- **[Healing Windows]**: Heal only after dodging long animations like hammer slams or sword rain attacks.
- **[Ranged Strategies]**:
   - Sorcerers can use spells like *Comet Azur* during moments when Morgott is distracted by summons.
   - Incantation users should rely on Scarlet Rot spells like *Rotten Breath* or Fire-based incantations like *Flame Sling*.

### [**Rewards for Defeating Morgott**]
1. **[120,000 Runes]** (or more depending on NG+ cycle).
2. **[Remembrance of the Omen King]**, which can be exchanged at Roundtable Hold for either:
   - *Morgott’s Cursed Sword*: A curved greatsword with Bleed buildup.
   - *Regal Omen Bairn*: A reusable item that summons spirits to attack enemies (scales with Intelligence and Faith).
3. **[Morgott’s Great Rune]**, which greatly increases maximum HP when activated at the Divine Tower of East Altus.

Morgott combines familiar moves from Margit with new abilities that test your adaptability and patience. By preparing adequately, summoning allies for support, and exploiting his weaknesses to Slash damage and status effects, you’ll overcome this pivotal challenge and continue your journey through *Elden Ring*.
